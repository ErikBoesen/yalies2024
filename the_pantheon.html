    <h2>The Zoo Instructions</h2>
    <p>Dear CS majors, the Pantheon is now dead. You now have to use the Zoo.</p>
    <p>We use SSH now instead of telnet. Welcome to the 21st century. Oh, you've never heard of SSH before? Well, you're in for a wild ride... SSHing into the Zoo computers that run Fedora Linux (IT'S NOT FUCKING UNIX. LINUX IS A UNIX-LIKE OPERATING SYSTEM. STOP PISSING OFF LINUS TORVALDS.) is like using your computer, but without the fancy pictures.. or any for that matter unless you count ASCII art.</p>
    <p>To connect, open your favorite SSH client and connect to <code>node.zoo.cs.yale.edu</code>, which will connect you to a random available computer on the Zoo. Also configure your SSH client to use your netid as your username. And at least for the first login, use your net id password for password-based authentication.
    </p>
    <p>Don't want to do the Duo authentication prompts every time? Setup ssh keys! Google how to generate an RSA key pair for your respective OS, then copy it in the right format to the <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file under your account on the Zoo. Now you will never have to type a password nor do two-factor authentication to log on to the Zoo again!
    </p>

    <h2>Vim Instructions</h2>
    <p>I'm also going to teach you the best text editor there is that you can use on the Zoo. Nothing even compares to the efficiency you can get using this editor. There are only a few essential things you need to know.</p>
    <p>Actually, all you need to know is how to exit vim. Don't be one of those people that shutdown their computer because they open Vim, intentionally or not, and can not for the life of them figure out how to exit it. To exit, depending on your current mode within vim, press ESC once or twice. Then, type <code>:q</code> and hit enter. Congratulations, you have exited vim.</p>
    <p>I'm not going to spoon feed you how to use every single piece of software on the Zoo. Use the <code>man</code> command to learn about them! For example to learn the basic of vim, run <code>man vim</code>.</p>
