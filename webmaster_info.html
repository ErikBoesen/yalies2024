			You can be right, or you can be popular. But you can't be both, at least

		<p>
			You can have your cake, and eat it too. But eventually, something's gotta
			give.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink. Sometimes, no
			matter what you do, people just won't listen.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can try to please everyone, but it's a fool's errand. In the end,
			you'll just end up pleasing no one, including yourself.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can talk a big game, but it's all hot air. When it comes down to it,
			you ain't got the goods.

		"Oh great, another entitled Yale student thinking they can please everyone.
		Newsflash: it's not possible. In fact, the chances of pleasing even a measly
		75% of the Yale community are slim to none. But please, go ahead and try.
		It's not like anyone has better things to do than watch you inevitably fail.
		Oh, and if you're having a bad day, don't worry. I'm sure someone will
		eventually throw you a pity party. And before you judge me, just know that
		the internet is a forced medium of expression. So if you want to truly hate
		me, you'll have to meet me in person. But don't worry, I'm sure I'm not as
		terrible as I seem online. Just ask anyone who knows me...oh wait, you can't
		because I don't have any real friends. But hey, feel free to send me an IM
		or email if you want to join the illustrious Class of 04 Database. Spoiler
		alert: it's not as exclusive as it sounds."
